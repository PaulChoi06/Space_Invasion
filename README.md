Date Started: Jan 2021 || Date Ended: March 2021

This game was inspired  by Space Invaders.
The game is about progressing through the planets in our ecosystem.
There are 6 levels: Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
You have 5 hearts.
After completing each level, the next level will get harder, but you will get an upraded weapon.

This is a full GUI game, with buttons, mouse positioning, mouse click, and more.

MECHANICS:  
  Spaceship image is the character you move.
  The spaceship tracks where your cursor is on the window and moves where the mouse is.
  
  Click to shoot lasers out of the spaceship.
  
  In every level you will have points. If you get a certain amount of points in a level, you move on.
  You will need more points to move on after each level.
  
  List of meteors that adjusts the amount meteor images are on teh screen.
  
  
OBJECTIVE:
  Destroy the meteors falling in each level in order to survive.
  
  Live long enough so that you can move on to the next level.
  
  If you get to Neptune, you "win"
  There is no actual prize though :(
